I"<p>“Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost.”</p>

<p>― Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy</p>

<p>It’s been a while now since I’ve written my last post and a lot of things happened since then 
The idea of me stopping things like blogging and other activities I like for work or searching for a job have always haunted me but it seems like it’s to some extent unscapeable I started feeling like dante at the start of his journey through hell the hardest thing after graduation is picking up your own path but I found out even when you know where you going it’s not always enough</p>

<p>This is one of my happiest moments of this past few months</p>

<p>Let’s start by a short briefing of how horrible my new year resolution is going in the first quarter of 2022</p>

<p>I can bearly pronounce the Russian alphabet (I wanted to challange myself by learning a langueage from a differernt alphabet) regarding my language learning goals 
Only 3 times I attempted to try tidytuesday and weren’t even public ones
I’m gaining weight again and almost neglecting all the computer vision tasks 
So in short it’s been hard to keep up with it</p>

<p>Career wise I was snuped by Go a ride sharing company I felt bad like really bad because it was a data related job but I also know that I wasn’t really the best candidate so their decision was understandable but it still hurts
Pushed by the desire to get my first job and get the illusion of financial independence I started another job it’s not as technically challenging or data centric as the one from Go but it still worth exploring two weeks in and I still haven’t fully made up my mind about it yet it has its pros and cons so no easy decsion here</p>

<p>I now feel lost I was so naive thinking I wasn’t naive 
Like I’ve always knew that’s life is hard and that life after graduation is a lot harder than before it but I somehow imagined it to be different let’s just say I thought it’s going to hard in different kind of way</p>

<p>“How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in
this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be
perfectly heartless.”
“Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter
would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins
quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.”
“I say it’s perfectly heartless you are eating muffins at all, under
the circumstances.”</p>

</ul>

<p>I don’t know if my current job will lead me to the career I want but then again do I even know what is? that and most importantly do I have what it takes to make it in that career
I think people especially younger one tend to be passionate about their jobs now even though that’s not a bad thing but personally can view a job that way I don’t think I just want to be one thing in life even though I know I kind of have to in today’s world</p>

<p>Do I quit next week even though I had no problems so far or just wait and slowly drifting away from the path I thought I’m going to walk 
I should apply for scholarships and leave and then I’ll think about what will happens but that then will definitely come and all of this will be repeated but with the stakes being higher 
I don’t want to give up my dreams but sadly I know I might not afford to follow them</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know what to do at this point of my life I feel there’s only bad and worse decisions only here</p>
