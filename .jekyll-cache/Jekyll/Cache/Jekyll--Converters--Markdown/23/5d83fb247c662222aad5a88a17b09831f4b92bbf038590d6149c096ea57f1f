As someone who didnâ€™t like giving or asking for advices, starting a blog where Iâ€™m sharing my ideas and opinons might seems like a contradiction, but as I said in the very first post of this blog Iâ€™m doing this for my own benefit. whenever Iâ€™m writing a new post Iâ€™m practically talking to myself, but if someone somehow finds it useful then thatâ€™s awesome, but its not my goal to tell people what to do Iâ€™m just sharing my thoughts from my humble experience.</p>

<h2 id="why-i-dont-like-advices">Why I Donâ€™t Like Advices</h2>
<p>I think I need more elaboration on why I â€œhateâ€ advices. Donâ€™t get me wrong  I do believe that sometimes some types of advices  works, I just think that most of â€œsuccessfulâ€ people tend to believe that thier journey is completely replicable when in fact no oneâ€™s is. Thereâ€™s so many examples of very successful people didnâ€™t realize that they were doing the right thing until it eventually paid off  and sometimes they donâ€™t even comprehend how circumstances played in their advantage and how luck can actually determine a lot of your decisions in life.</p>

<p>The other day I was reading about Bayesian statistics and found out that in fact Thomas Bayes who actually came up with the conditional probability equation which we now know as bayes theorem one of the most important theorems in statistics (if not the most ) he never published it because he didnâ€™t think it something of any value in fact it was published after his death and we have Thomasâ€™s friend Richard Price to thank for that who found it his apartment and arranged it for its posthumous publication (actually while writing this I found this so interesting that it deserves a whole post on its own). I remember also reading something similar franz kafka the genius novelist ordered his servant to burn all of his useless mediocre work (in his opinion) after his death, but luckily for humanity his servant didnâ€™t listen to him.
Some people  just love asking for advices even on obvious things Goerge hotz the  founder of comma ai (a company that makes self driving cars computers) said this when he was asked about giving advices to this type ofpeople â€œI will write a self help book and charge 67$ for it then right on the cover of this book : all of this advices are meaningless but you gonna be sucker and buy it anywayâ€ I loved his answer because sometimes people wants to be told advices jyst because it would make them feel better about themselves theyâ€™ll think just by seeking advices theyâ€™re already better people which is nice way to think about yourself I guess but can be very misleading.</p>

<p>I think the only type of advices you can actually give are either technical or very specific where you almost giving instructions. You canâ€™t give advice for someone who asks â€œhow can I learn X  ?â€ I donâ€™t know, Google it ? â€œhow can I be good at Yâ€ do it a lot maybe. These types of questions are annoying, I mean a lot  of things in this life just kind of work out, if someone would ask me how i managed to get high score in a certain exam Iâ€™d probably tell them to ware blue shirt on the day of the exam because I  remember doing better in exams when I wore blue shirts this as relevant as telling them to study hard or telling them not to skip lectures. I  think deep down they exactly what they should do and what they are really after is the sense of reassurance that comes from people giving us advices because at the end what is an advice anyway ? I  like to define it as my best guess to how thinks actually work out to best case scenario and guess is the real keyword here you never know what really happened. I think you can actually tell a lot about people just by how comfortable theyâ€™re with saying â€œI donâ€™t knowâ€.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I have to admit that my view is a bit extrem on here and this whole post will be  so awkward if  I do  publish a book or give a talk at some event in which Iâ€™m baisclly , but who knows maybe I look back at this post few years from now and Iâ€™ll feel  proud that I changed the way I think about this. 
Finally if I had to give someone one piece of advice it would definitely be â€œdo not listen to meâ€</p>
