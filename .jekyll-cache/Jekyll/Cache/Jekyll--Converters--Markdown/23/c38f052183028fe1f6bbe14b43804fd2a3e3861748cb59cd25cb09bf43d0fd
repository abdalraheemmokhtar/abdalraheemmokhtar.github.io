I"¹<p>A lot of time we tend to underrate some factors that can actually have huge effect on your learning experience and your whole productivity in general. Here Iâ€™ll go over some basic skills that I think are essential and can have a tremendous impact on your learning and help you in everyday work.</p>
<h3 id="touch-typing">Touch typing</h3>
<p>I think everyone whoâ€™s doing some kind of work thatâ€™s evolves a Keyboard should know how to type fast. Thereâ€™s a lot of free websites that teach you how to  master touch typing, Iâ€™ll give links and descriptions to them below. typing fast is a very satisfying skill to have  and youâ€™ll feel your progress while doing it which is  great if you impatient or the type of person that loses interest in things quickly when you donâ€™t see fast or direct  results, even though I still type at a pathetic rate of (45-50 Word Per Minute according to 10fastfingers ) and itâ€™s even slower when I write code (because of the  parentheses and stuff) still Iâ€™ve came a long way from using my index fingers to type almost everything and Iâ€™m still improving. Iâ€™m hoping that Iâ€™ll be able to reach at least 80 wpm by the end of this year</p>
<h3 id="speed-reading">Speed Reading</h3>
<p>I think compared to typing reading is less obvious skill to improve no one thinks that they actually need to improve their reading speed, but just like typing itâ€™s not only about speed but rather the techniques that allow for faster and more efficient output from reading through. I learned this the hard way when I was doing literature review for my graduation project and I had to skim through a lot of papers, books and articles I literally had to read pages diagonally because I canâ€™t read everything, I knew that this has to Improve and I have to read faster without sacrifice my comprehension.
Also similar to touch typing thereâ€™s a lot of  websites that help you learn techniques and practice them to improve your reading skills 
When you combine this two skills youâ€™ll find yourself saving a good amount of time that you didnâ€™t even knew you were wasting. average person reads from 200 to 300 words per minute but you can reach much higher rates(x2 or x3 !!)  with practice.</p>
