<p>Through my journey between web devolopment and data science iâ€™ve wasted so much time, effort and resources without actuchlly leveling up my skills, I have always found my self in this limbo of being way better than a begginer and yet far from a profissonal.
Now even though I no where near my goals for my progress in data science (which is my main interest currently) but taking note of these shortcomings of my learning progress really helping me to be more effective. so the goal of these post is to help others save precious time that i wasted, so letâ€™s get started.</p>
<h2 id="youre-doing-the-oppiste-of-less-is-more">Youâ€™re doing the oppiste of â€œless is moreâ€</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ve always like this qoute the first time i knew about it was when reading about linux commands and the less command was actully used to show details of a file therefore more of that file, â€œbut does this have to do with me not making progressâ€ you might rightfully ask, well the my first advice is to work with as LESS learning resources as possible (courses, books, blog posts,â€¦ect) this migh seem counter intuitave at first but if you are anything like me a person who litterly wants to know everything at the same time. might find yourself very distracted with tons of course youâ€™ll never finish and PDFs you never really read.
So the best advice i can give you is to not do more than one course or a book simultanously this when make you understand details better and you will not feel rushed to finish it for the sake of it.</p>
<h2 id="youre-comparing-between-technologies">Youâ€™re comparing between technologies</h2>
<p>So is it Python or R, Tensorflow or Pytorch, React or Angular or Vue, bla bla bla this is the most useless conversation or web search youâ€™ll ever make, But belevie it or not this kind of things really wast a lot of time becuase the will discourge you and get you to switch in the middle of the road recentlly Iâ€™ve come across a tweet by fronca collet the creator of keras which really summries my whole point here perfectlly â€œâ€. so next time when you have this kind of thoughs try to think about what are you making and the How part will be easier.</p>
<h2 id="you-think-you-can-master-it-in-short-time-with-little-effort">You think you can master it in short time with little effort</h2>
<p>by now you might start to see the pattern or what all of this have in common â€œThe search for short cutsâ€ this is your enemy  i remember when  watching â€œrequim for a dreamâ€  the first time and thought itâ€™s about how bad drugs are but the i read the the director derren arnofsky said that the film actuclly has nothing to do about that instead itâ€™s about the sequences of trying to cheat your way through life. I wonâ€™t spoil the film here but i think youâ€™ll get it. when you try to finish more books and courses or any other resources maybe series of blogs or articls youâ€™re doing the same your goal changes from gaining knowledge and skills to finish this as fast as possible.
Sorry to break it down for you but there no way you can gain the knowlge and experiance of s . to be good at things you have to be consistant, displined and patient other wise youâ€™re cheating your self and wasting your time. benge watching tutorials and courses will not make you a CTO.</p>
