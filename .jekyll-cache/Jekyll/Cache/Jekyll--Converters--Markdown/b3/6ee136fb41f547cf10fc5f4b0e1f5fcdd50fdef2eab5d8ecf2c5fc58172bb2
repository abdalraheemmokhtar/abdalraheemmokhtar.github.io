I"y<p>Let just say that October is now my least favorite month of the year, it started awfully and somehow managed to finish even worse. By 20th October I was at one of the most stressful periods I had in a while academically, socially, financially and most importantly mentally.  The combination of this factors lead me to be in mental state I thought I would never be in  again (state where you do not want to do things rationally and just want to make things go away and misdirecting your anger at the wrong things and people ), but still all of this was somehow bearable because I’m few weeks away from graduating so that was one thing helping me, but When the coup happened few days later the feelings of hopelessness and despair magnified. I was so shocked and I actually laughed for how serreal was the situation. Nothing made sense to me “this can’t be really happening”.</p>
