I"j<p>One benefit of having your birthday so close to new year eve is that you don’t have to make two resolutions. My plans for my 24th year of life and 2022 are the same thing. I have said before that this year was fairly good and I have learned new things, seen new places, and met some wonderful people. So today I’m sharing my goals for the year 2022!.</p>
