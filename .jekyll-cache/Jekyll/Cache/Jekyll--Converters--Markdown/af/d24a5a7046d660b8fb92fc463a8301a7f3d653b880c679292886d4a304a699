I"Á<p>Long time no see I kind of missed my own blog isnâ€™t that sad, but finally I finished college (hopefully that will be official next week) and I was busy with exams, graduation project and another project also I was a part of a mentorship program and I already gave two session so the past two months have been somehow eventful, but still Iâ€™d say that it was my laziness and procrastination that prevented me from blogging this whole time.</p>
