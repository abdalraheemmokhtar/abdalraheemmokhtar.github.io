I"8<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Through my journey between web devolopment and data science I’ve wasted so much time, effort and resources without actuchlly leveling up my skills, I have always found my self in this limbo of being way better than a begginer and yet far from a profissonal.
Now even though I’m no where near my goals for my progress in data science (which is my main interest currently) but taking note of these shortcomings of my learning journey is really helping me to be more productive. so the goal of these post is to help others save precious time that I wasted, so let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="youre-doing-the-opposite-of-less-is-more">You’re doing the opposite of “less is more”</h2>
<p>I’ve always liked this qoute the first time I knew about it was when I was reading about linux commands and the “less” was used to show the contents of a file therefore more of that file, “but what does this have to do with me not making progress” you might rightfully ask, well the my first advice is to work with as LESS learning resources as possible (courses, books, blog posts,…ect) this might seem counterintuitive at first but if you’re anything like me (a person who litterly wants to know everything at the same time),you might find yourself very distracted with tons of courses you’ll never finish and PDFs you never really read.
So the best advice I can give you is to not do more than one course or a book simultanously this will make you understand details better and you will not feel rushed to finish it for the sake of it.</p>
