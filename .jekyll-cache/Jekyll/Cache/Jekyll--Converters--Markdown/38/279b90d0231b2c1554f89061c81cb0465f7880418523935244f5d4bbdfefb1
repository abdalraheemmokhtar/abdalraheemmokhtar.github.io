<p>When I first started to learn about machine learning and data science it didn’t make any sense for me to learn any other language than python 
It’s easy to learn and code in,
Requires minimum installations of other programs so you can get started quickly, has a library for almost every thing I needed,  and I already had some experience in it from my web development days (back when I was using Django framework) so learning something like R seemed redundant and  unnecessary so I never really cared about it.</p>
