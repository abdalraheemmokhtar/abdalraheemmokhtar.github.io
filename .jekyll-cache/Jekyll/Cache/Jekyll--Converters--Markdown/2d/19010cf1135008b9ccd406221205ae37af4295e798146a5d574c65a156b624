As someone who didnâ€™t like giving or asking for advices, starting a blog where Iâ€™m sharing my ideas and opinons might seems like a contradiction, but as I said in the very first post of this blog Iâ€™m doing this for my own benefit. whenever Iâ€™m writing a new post Iâ€™m practically talking to myself, but if someone somehow finds it useful then thatâ€™s awesome, but its not my goal to tell people what to do Iâ€™m just sharing my thoughts from my humble experience.</p>
