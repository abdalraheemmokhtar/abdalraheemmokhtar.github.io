I"§<p>15 july 2021 I wrote my very first post here (https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/07/15/first-post.html)
I can not believe that itâ€™s been a whole year since that day!. I never thought that more than one year later I would be still writing these posts even though Iâ€™m not doing it as frequently as I would like to but at least Iâ€™m still trying.</p>

<hr />

<p>Itâ€™s both terrifying and amazing how fast time is going 
Iâ€™ve been through a lot of ups and downs throughout this year, finished school, worked in 3 places and met a lot of amazing new people.</p>

<p>I remember writing about being stressed out about my graduation project which now is a bit nostalgic. I remember my post dreaming about working at tesla or comma ai which helps me remember who I am and what I want and how ambitious I am.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had a small conversation with my friends this weekend about whether itâ€™s better to have a dreams or just live your life not wanting so much and having â€œreasonable goalsâ€ now while that sounds the rational thing to do I really think that youâ€™ll only regret having ambition and big dreams only if you give up on them without trying if you tried and failed then thatâ€™s fine thatâ€™s just life then or at least this is how I think. I will never regret having a far fetched dream more than I hate the fact I chose the comfortable path and didnâ€™t try even though Iâ€™m quite aware I might never achieve what I want.</p>

<p>Looking back now Iâ€™m super glad I started this blog really and I already can not wait for next year (if Iâ€™m not dead of course ) to see what I would be writing and how Iâ€™m thinking about stuff</p>

<p>I want to thank a friend of mine because she was the very first supporter of this blog and I mightâ€™ve not started blogging if it wasnâ€™t for her. Thanks Sondus.</p>

<p>I know that in my final post I promised that I would write more frequently but ended up actually disappearing longer and longer. I hate this too but this is what adult life is right?</p>

<p>Hopefully this time I really get back to consistently writing these blog posts at least once a week. Until then, take a slice of the cake and wish this blog a happy birthday.</p>
