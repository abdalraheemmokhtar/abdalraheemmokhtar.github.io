I"Ë<p>If think this is actually my last blog post then I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you, but I‚Äôm not going to stop, at least not for the foreseeable future. Why the drama then? well, I actually thought about quitting before especially after last post for many reasons, but I reconsidered and decided that I‚Äôm not going to. Below I‚Äôll give an explanation to why I thought about stopping this blog, why I changed my mind and when I will really stop. 
Reasons To Stop
Although I said many times that the main beneficiary from this blog is me, I still however care about the opinions of the people reading my posts (there‚Äôs only about 10 currently) and for some reason there was relatively low feed back especially for the last post and I started thinking the wrong way (like I always do) which is that because how uninteresting they are. I thought ‚Äúno one asked and no one cares about your opinions, they only interacted with first ones out of pity and now got bored from pretending to care‚Äù.</p>
