The performances were extraordinary, and the music was incredibly catchy. The story of Alexander Hamilton was brought to life in such a captivating way. I was blown away by the talent of the cast and the creativity of the production. Hamilton is truly a masterpiece that everyone should experience. Here are some profound takeaways from this cultural phenomenon:</p>

<h3 id="1-elections-what-does-that-even-means">1. Elections? what does that even means</h3>

<p>In the 18th century, the United States held elections, a fact that struck me profoundly. Reflecting on this historical backdrop amid my country’s current struggle with a civil war in 2023, primarily fueled by the inability to peacefully transition authority, evoked a profound mix of sadness, disappointment, and anger. “Hamilton” serves as a poignant reminder of the significance of democratic processes and the imperative need for a peaceful transfer of power, especially for countries with fragile nature like Sudan</p>

<h3 id="2-write-like-theres-no-tomorrow">2. Write Like There’s No Tomorrow</h3>

<p>The emphasis on writing as a superpower, epitomized by Hamilton’s relentless penmanship, left an enduring impression. While contemporary times may argue for diverse means of expression, the narrative highlights the transformative potential of the written word. Writing not only shapes individual legacies but has the power to influence societal perspectives, an aspect often underestimated in our fast-paced world. When I started this blog I intended for it to have a limited audience because I thought that only (or mainly) myself and people close to me can benefit from it but to see that the history of one of the greatest countries in the history of man kind substantially transformed by a single man who believed in the power of writing and sharing his ideas is surely remarkable.</p>

<h3 id="3-legacy-as-a-trees-unseen-growth">3. Legacy as a Tree’s Unseen Growth</h3>

<p>The notion that “legacy is a seed for a tree you would not see grow” resonates deeply. This reminds me of a quote from Vagabond, when young Musashi was tied to the tree telling the monk Takuan that life is meaningless, to which the monk replies: “Indeed, life is meaningless if you think only about yourself”. I think it can even be liberating to realize that your life is not about rather about a bigger purpose you service. Each person, should strive to contribute to something that outlives individual existence.</p>

<h3 id="4-the-world-is-wide-enough-for-all">4. The World is Wide Enough for All</h3>

<p>A particularly impactful scene, reminiscent of Aaron Burr’s realization after shooting Hamilton, drew parallels to Sudan’s current predicament. The pervasive zero-sum mindset, akin to infinite Burrs in our society, perpetuates destructive ideologies:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scarce resources and limited avenues for a good life.</li>
  <li>Maximizing personal gain at the expense of others’ losses.</li>
  <li>Shifting ideologies and moral codes opportunistically.</li>
  <li>Becoming the institution to be irreplaceable, even if it means systematically destroying it.</li>
</ul>

<p>We are a country of million Burr</p>

<h3 id="5-stand-for-something-or-fall-for-anything">5. Stand for Something or Fall for Anything</h3>

<p>I think this is pretty self-explanatory but it can be tricky because we do not always understand the implications of what we stand for, we can easily claim to stand for something noble but when we are truly tested only few maintain consistency and stay true to their core values.</p>

<h3 id="6-do-not-throw-away-your-shot">6. Do Not Throw Away Your Shot</h3>

<p>Hamilton’s anthem, “My Shot,” serves as a motivational refrain urging action. In our everyday lives, this translates into recognizing opportunities for positive impact. Your “shot” may not entail changing the world; it could be as simple as fulfilling the mundane tasks at hand with dedication and purpose.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[After hearing so much about it, I finally watched Hamilton and it completely lived up to the hype!

While experience undoubtedly brings valuable insights and skills, relying solely on this metric can be limiting and may lead to overlooking highly competent candidates. Human Resources (HR) professionals and recruiters need to evolve their approach and adopt more nuanced methods for candidate assessment that prioritize skills, adaptability, and potential.</p>

<h2 id="the-limitations-of-the-experience-paradigm">The Limitations of the Experience Paradigm</h2>

<h3 id="1-rapid-technological-advancements">1. Rapid Technological Advancements</h3>
<p>The pace of technological change is unprecedented, especially in fields like information technology, artificial intelligence, and digital marketing. A candidate with 10 years of experience may be well-versed in outdated technologies, while a recent graduate may possess cutting-edge skills. The ability to adapt and learn quickly is often more crucial than the number of years spent in the industry.</p>

<h3 id="2-diverse-career-paths">2. Diverse Career Paths</h3>
<p>Candidates often follow non-traditional career paths, acquiring skills and expertise outside the typical trajectory. A candidate who transitioned from a different industry or pursued a varied skill set through self-learning and projects may bring a fresh perspective and innovative problem-solving abilities, challenging the notion that a linear career path equates to competence.</p>

<h3 id="3-inclusive-hiring-practices">3. Inclusive Hiring Practices</h3>
<p>Relying heavily on years of experience can perpetuate biases in the hiring process. It may exclude qualified individuals who took career breaks, pursued further education, or engaged in alternative learning experiences. By broadening the evaluation criteria, HR professionals can contribute to more inclusive hiring practices and tap into a diverse talent pool.</p>

<h2 id="shifting-focus-competence-based-hiring">Shifting Focus: Competence-Based Hiring</h2>

<h3 id="1-skills-assessment">1. Skills Assessment</h3>
<p>Rather than fixating on the number of years a candidate has worked, HR professionals should focus on evaluating specific skills relevant to the job. Implementing skills assessments, whether through practical exercises or simulated tasks, can provide a more accurate representation of a candidate’s abilities.</p>

<h3 id="2-behavioral-interviews">2. Behavioral Interviews</h3>
<p>Conducting behavioral interviews that explore a candidate’s problem-solving skills, adaptability, and collaboration can provide insights into how they approach challenges. Behavioral questions delve into past experiences and actions, allowing recruiters to gauge a candidate’s potential to contribute positively to the team.</p>

<h3 id="3-continuous-learning-and-growth">3. Continuous Learning and Growth</h3>
<p>Candidates who exhibit a commitment to continuous learning and professional growth are likely to stay relevant in a rapidly evolving work environment. Assessing a candidate’s willingness to upskill and adapt to new challenges can be more indicative of their future success than relying solely on past experiences.</p>

<h2 id="embracing-change-for-a-brighter-future">Embracing Change for a Brighter Future</h2>

<p>As the business landscape continues to evolve, so should our approach to hiring. While experience remains a valuable asset, HR professionals and recruiters must recognize that competence is multifaceted. By shifting the focus towards skills, adaptability, and potential, organizations can foster innovation, diversity, and a more inclusive work culture.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the traditional emphasis on years of experience as the primary measure of competence is becoming outdated. It’s time for HR professionals and recruiters to embrace a more holistic approach to hiring, one that values skills, adaptability, and potential. By doing so, organizations can build dynamic and forward-thinking teams that thrive in the face of constant change.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the dynamic landscape of today’s job market, the traditional emphasis on years of experience as the primary indicator of competence is facing increasing scrutiny.

<p>Similar to other millions of Sudanese my life changed drastically after April 15th 2023. I’ve lost everything my house, my car, my job and I’m thousands of miles away from my family in a foreign country.</p>

<p>The terrors of this war do not require me to speak further about them. the atrocities committed by the RSF left the whole world shocked not just Sudanese people. But as you might have guessed from the title of this post I’m going to talk about the positive things that I learned or happened to me during this series of unfortunate events.</p>

<h3 id="im-way-stronger-than-i-could-have-ever-imagined">I’m way stronger than I could have ever imagined</h3>

<p>Days without water, electricity, internet connection have been the norm for many residents of Khartoum (and even other states). Along with my family we fled to our home town in Aljazeera state about 80km south of Khartoum, our house there wasn’t a 5 star hotel of course but we are extremely lucky to have a “spare” house that we could live in. I spent days without electricity, fastest internet connection was in kilo bytes if you were patient enough to stay up all night long to use it, for many days I forgot the taste of cold water. while this was happening all I did was wondering how did I ever had the audacity to complain previously about anything in my life but also I was surprised by how much adaptable I was to the whole situation, sure not having an alternative solution back then helped but still I realized how much of our inability to do things or bear any conditions was due to our own mentality.</p>

<h3 id="i-found-peace-in-losing-all-hope">“I found peace in losing all hope”</h3>

<p>Losing Hope, I know that this seems like a negative thing but losing hope in things that holding you back can be one of the most liberating things ever “only after we’ve lost everything we are free to do anything” war destroyed every comfort zone I had before in life making it easier for me to take on harder challenges and choose harder decisions.</p>

<h3 id="زايلة-و-زايل-نعيمكي">“زايلة و زايل نعيمكي”</h3>

<p>Life is ultimately a zero sum game you have nothing to gain and truly nothing to lose. Nothing last forever and whatever is it that you work so hard for in this life can be easily taken away from you without your permission, without you seeing it coming and without it being your fault.</p>

<h3 id="control-is-an-illusion">Control Is An Illusion</h3>

<p>We tend to think that we are in complete control over our life, our hard-work will get us so far in life, we get things because we deserve them, good things will happen to us because we are good people, and the truth is that none of these is actually true, the worst day or the best day of your life could be around the corner and you wouldn’t even know it or predict it let alone trying to control when or where or with whom it might be. Of course I’m not downplaying the importance of hard-working -if this what you understood from reading this then please stop reading- I’m just saying we should stop the wishful thinking that’s all, basically do your best and be ready for the worst because that’s life.</p>

<h3 id="i-love-sudan">I love Sudan</h3>

<p>I love Sudan and I really love it more than I thought I’d ever do as far as I could remember I wanted to leave Sudan and establish a new life for me away from everyone I know, now this is actually happening I don’t find it as rewarding as I thought it would be. I desperately want to get my old life back, I want to go back to Sudan and I want to spend my life working towards making it a better home for future generations. No matter how many years I spend outside of Sudan or which nationality I can get, there’s an ultimate truth that is I will always be Sudanese and I wish that one day far down the line people would be proud of this instead of feeling that it’s just a bad luck for them. If I could meaningfully contribute to that then that’s it for me.</p>

<h3 id="im-a-good-digital-painter-now">I’m a good digital painter now!</h3>

<p>Not all these “spoils” are philosophical some are tangible things I gained from this war, one of which was improving my painting skills, I have been practicing more consistently during the past months and it was so satisfying to watch my skills grow and finally have confidence in my skills and I can now paint faster using my own unique styles and techniques, honestly this was my sole goal since I got into drawing and painting this is literally a life long dream to acquire this skill. All that was possible because of the time this war has given me by taking away things that had more priority in my life, so it’s good to see some light in all of this darkness.</p>

<p>Spoils of war is the 4th episode of season 7 of Game of Thrones, it’s also the name of one the best sound tracks in this show and I liked it so much it was only fitting to make it the title of this post.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spoils of war]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Back on Track</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/13/comeback.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Back on Track" /><published>2023-08-13T11:45:13+00:00</published><updated>2023-08-13T11:45:13+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2023/08/13/comeback</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2023/08/13/comeback.html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="hello-friend">Hello Friend</h3>
<p>Frist of all it really does feel good to be back writing these posts, it feels like the last time I did this was years ago, I even started to forget how write, build and maintain the github repo. It’s been two years since I decided to start doing this and man what a great descion was it! throughout the time when I couldn’t publish new posts I read most of my old posts and I really felt a lot of different emotions from laughing at how I was stressed about my graduation project to feeling sad remember some special moments and people who were crucial to my journey with this blog but now we don’t even talk.</p>

<h3 id="again-time-flies">Again Time Flies</h3>
<p>Since 2018 and it’s almost like time has been going faster than ever, I cloud swear that all of 202X seems like one long year, so much happened wars, pandamics, coups …etc. And now 2024 is in like 4 months.</p>

<h3 id="new-city-new-world-new-life">New City, New World, New Life</h3>
<p>Like many of Sudanese People I left Sudan after the war broke out, I moved to dubai 3 weeks ago, it’s funny I arrived here on the same day I was here 2 years ago, once as a tourist and now a refugee life is really weird and unexpected.
Hopefully I’ll be able to find some stability and kick-off my career again in a new environment, but it’s quite tough for someone without many years of experience yet I’m still confident that I will be able to make the best out of my situation.</p>

<p>Ramadan Kareem, everyone! It’s been a long time since I wrote any posts here. I almost forgot how to do this. I’ve only made like four posts in the entirety of 2022 and this is my very first post in 2023 !! but I’m planning to be more productive this year (in what’s left of it). It’s crazy that this blog is 3 months away from being 2 years old, hopefully I’ll relate to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyVpRiqOvt4">video</a> some time in the future.</p>

<p>In life, we all have limited resources - whether it’s time, money, or energy. However, it’s not always about having more resources, but using the ones we have effectively. Learning how to make the most of your available resources can help you achieve your goals and live a more fulfilling life.</p>

<h2 id="jack-of-all-trades">Jack Of All Trades</h2>

<p>Since I could remember I was always obsessed with learning new things I wanted to learn everything I came across I wanted to be everything at the same time I wanted to master every track of my field I wanted to be a web developer, graphic designer, data scientist, machine learning engineer, … etc. I wanted to be a “jack of all trades” this in turn led me to spend so much time collecting resources for each of these and spend relatively less time actually learning and improving. If you recognize this pattern or relate to it in some way then you too has suffered from what I like to call scarcity of abundance.</p>

<p>Scarcity is defined as the lack of something but it’s not always generated by the absence of it as I mention in earlier hoarding courses and materials only made my learning outcomes very scarce. But how can one scape this?</p>

<h2 id="prioritizing-your-goals">Prioritizing Your Goals</h2>

<p>One of the most effective ways to make the most of your available resources is to prioritize your goals. By setting clear goals and prioritizing them, you can focus your time, energy, and resources on what matters most.</p>

<p>When you have a clear goal in mind, you can evaluate the importance of each task that requires resources to achieve it. Once you have a clear understanding of the importance of each task, you can make sure your resources are used effectively.</p>

<p>What if prioritizing your goals is also something you don’t know how to do? I’m sorry in that case because that means no one can help you currently as the saying goes “No winds are favorable for a ship without a destination.</p>

<p>Holding on to one thing is hard because of how appealing starting over is, we tend to do this all the time. This is because at the start things are relatively easier but as we get deeper at certain topic naturally  it require more effort so get tempted by the easiness of approaching a different thing and starting over. I think the ability to fight these temptations off are one of the biggest factors on personal success of an individual. This reminds me of one of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXqkTzyifJQ">my favorite Rick and Morty clip</a></p>

<p>Just an advice if you really don’t what your goals are or what you want to be then you can litrally choose at random just pick up anything and be good at it just like Abraham Lincoln said “whatever you are, be a good one”. What I’ve realized so far is people rarely realize what they really want or even when they do life doesn’t always allow them to fulfil them, you should prioritize your goals yes but also be flexible when life forces you to follow a different order.</p>

<h2 id="reinvent-your-resources">Reinvent Your Resources</h2>

<p>Being resourceful means finding creative ways to achieve your goals using the resources you have. This could mean finding free resources or using resources in new ways.</p>

<p>From a personal experience this has helped me a lot in learning Spanish language I never thought it’s possible to get to the level I got without going a class or having a real instructors. I started my journey with Duolingo it help me with the basics but after that I started adding Spanish content to my content diet I started listinting to spanish songs, spanish movies and series and spanish Youtube channels ( and spanish memes pages ). I was already listning to music and watching youtube but I repurposed it to help learning a new language and proud of the level I got to (nearly B2 ).</p>

<h2 id="remove-clutter">Remove Clutter</h2>

<p>My hate for social media combined with my inability to escape it always makes me feel a bit miserable all the time. We’ve been hacked and hooked by this platforms they changed the neuroplasticity of our brains and made tasks like focusing and paying attention kind of impossible to most people. when was the last time you were able to stay focused for like several hours or even finish a several hours movie in one setting (if your answer is yes then I really congrats you, you are ahead of so many people).</p>

<p>This is the clearest examples of scarcity of abundance we’re drowning in oceans of entertainment yet we are incredibly easily bored, we’re surrounded with people and “friends” and “followers” and yet we feel incredibly lonely, sometimes it makes you think the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/unabomber/manifesto.text.htm">Unabomber</a> had some sense (This is just a joke FBI).</p>

<p>Your brain will try to fight against this but if you blocked these sources of free dopamine; getting things done will get way easier (and even more fun!) remember when the goverment shut down the internet for weeks and then suddenly every one is finishing up books, movies, courses they had ? most people would tell you that it was their most productive time it kind of following the idea of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region-beta_paradox">region beta</a></p>

<h2 id="seeking-help">Seeking Help</h2>

<p>Seeking help when you need it is another way to make the most of your available resources. Sometimes, we may feel like we have to do everything on our own sense there is a huge of learning resources available online, but this is not always the case.</p>

<p>In fact, I’d like to argue that we can only learn things from others. I’m sorry, but there’s no such thing as “<em>self-learning</em>” Whenever I hear that term, I cringe. Whether you learned from YouTube, by reading books or blogs, or through other means, knowledge and experience have been passed down to you one way or another, even if it’s not in a conventional way. In this age of individualism, where one’s value is directly measured by personal achievements, seeking help may make us look vulnerable or inferior, but it’s actually the normal flow of knowledge.</p>

<p>Having a mentor is one of the best ways to level up in whatever skill you want. If you destroy your ego and break down the barriers, for example, you can reach out to people on LinkedIn and ask for help (yeah, not everything about social media is bad. Why are you looking at me like that?). One thing all competent people have in common is their desire to share knowledge and make it easier for others than it was for them. So, if you ever come across someone who tries to gatekeep knowledge, just know that they’re insecure (rightfully so) about their competence and you’re better off without them.</p>

<p>You know who can also be your mentor ? ChatGPT we really live in that time of human history which is INSANE. I’m going to write a post about this soon.</p>

<h2 id="automating-your-tasks">Automating Your Tasks</h2>

<p>Another way to make the most of your available resources is by automating your tasks. Automating your routine tasks can help you save time and energy that you can use on other important things. There are many tools and apps available that can help you automate your tasks, such as scheduling software, email filters, and social media management tools.</p>

<p>Automating things can help you remove the clutter also by reducing the time you need to interact with different social media and mail services</p>

<h2 id="collaborating-with-others">Collaborating With Others</h2>

<p>Collaborating with others is another way to make the most of your available resources. By working with others, you can combine your resources and achieve your goals more efficiently.</p>

<p>Joining forces with other people doesn’t only save you a lot of time it also makes you benchmark you and validate skills levels more accurately it’s easy to think that we’re left behind or do not have enough skills but when your working with someone and you know how good they are and you see them google the most basic things it kind of sparks some sort of confidence in you that one is expected to know everything all the time and I think in the age ChatGPT and all of these LLMs it’s becoming  more and more important to learn how and what to ask .</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It’s not always about having more resources, but using the ones you have effectively.</p>

<p>Few months ago I made this channel to keep track of books that I found interesting and now I think it has 350+ books and few useful links I only got to read like handful of them but I’m sharing it with you so hopefully you can benefit from it more <a href="https://t.me/+WUcu9zDtNP84OWQ8">here</a></p>

<p>Hello friend, long time no see, I missed writing blogs too, it’s been forever since the last time I uploaded something here which wasn’t intentional lets just say that I’ve been really busy these past couple of months</p>

<hr />
<p>Quick update last time we met here I was working with MTN. Now I’m working at GO digital services as a customer experience executive and I’m loving every part of it. Also I finally got my driving license, something I’ve been trying to get for a long time. Actually another thing is that I also went back to doing digital art and finally bought a drawing tablet.</p>

<p>a lot changed in this year. It’s crazy to talk about so many things for the first time. I think I really pushed myself this year. If someone would’ve told me that I would be able to handle two part-time jobs and one full-time job at the same time and still be able to have a social life and be in contact with my friends and family I honestly wouldn’t believe it. I really think more about my abilities and how to manage time.</p>

<p>Since I’ve decided to go back to blogging and couldn’t really came up with ideas to write about, I decided to write about the most recent interesting thing I’ve been to recently Indabax Sudan 2022.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="what-is-indabax-">What is IndabaX ??</h3>

<p>For those who don’t know, Indaba is an African AI and Machine learning event where experts from around the world gather in one country each year and share their knowledge and stories. The most recent one was in Tunisia. Indabax however is like the local version of the conference where the community of each country organizes a similar event on a smaller scale.</p>

<hr />
<p>I’ve never been to Indaba nor Indabax before (or any other events actually, like in my whole life ) so I was really excited about this one. I want to know a lot of things there here’s the main points I learned from attending Indabax Sudan 2022</p>

<ol>
  <li>There’s quite a big interest from young undergrad students (and from different academic backgrounds too !) in AI, ML and data science so there is actually an audience for this type of educational content.</li>
  <li>There’s a lot of amazing people who are doing great things with AI and ML and a lot of these things can be used in the context of Sudan.</li>
  <li>You can learn a lot and I mean really  a lot about something in one or two days (you won’t be an expert but you can go from zero to grasping the main concepts of something interesting).</li>
  <li>This is not new, however it is worth repeating that networking is a key, you just have to throw yourself out there for the people who share your interest in things you should never underestimate how much this can help you in your life.</li>
</ol>

<p>I really enjoyed the first 2 days of Index this year and can’t wait for the next weekend when the more advanced stuff starts. I also enjoyed getting back to doing this I enjoyed every keystroke of this post.</p>

<p>Hopefully I see you soon,
Goodbye.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[*wipes the dust of this blog*]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Happy Birthday!!</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/07/21/happy-birthday.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Happy Birthday!!" /><published>2022-07-21T12:45:13+00:00</published><updated>2022-07-21T12:45:13+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/07/21/happy-birthday</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/07/21/happy-birthday.html"><![CDATA[<p>15 july 2021 I wrote my very first post here (https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/07/15/first-post.html)
I can not believe that it’s been a whole year since that day!. I never thought that more than one year later I would be still writing these posts even though I’m not doing it as frequently as I would like to but at least I’m still trying.</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s both terrifying and amazing how fast time is going 
I’ve been through a lot of ups and downs throughout this year, finished school, worked in 3 places and met a lot of amazing new people.</p>

<p>I remember writing about being stressed out about my graduation project which now is a bit nostalgic. I remember my post dreaming about working at tesla or comma ai which helps me remember who I am and what I want and how ambitious I am.</p>

<hr />

<p>I had a small conversation with my friends this weekend about whether it’s better to have a dreams or just live your life not wanting so much and having “reasonable goals” now while that sounds the rational thing to do I really think that you’ll only regret having ambition and big dreams only if you give up on them without trying if you tried and failed then that’s fine that’s just life then or at least this is how I think. I will never regret having a far fetched dream more than I hate the fact I chose the comfortable path and didn’t try even though I’m quite aware I might never achieve what I want.</p>

<p>Looking back now I’m super glad I started this blog really and I already can not wait for next year (if I’m not dead of course ) to see what I would be writing and how I’m thinking about stuff</p>

<p>I want to thank a friend of mine because she was the very first supporter of this blog and I might’ve not started blogging if it wasn’t for her. Thanks Sondus.</p>

<p>I know that in my final post I promised that I would write more frequently but ended up actually disappearing longer and longer. I hate this too but this is what adult life is right?</p>

<p>Hopefully this time I really get back to consistently writing these blog posts at least once a week. Until then, take a slice of the cake and wish this blog a happy birthday.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[15 july 2021 I wrote my very first post here (https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/07/15/first-post.html) I can not believe that it’s been a whole year since that day!.

two weeks ago I had a horrible toothache and had my tooth extracted I’ve ignored for a while and I do regret that Now.</p>

<p>Also I’m starting to realize that my current job isn’t what I want to be doing for the rest of my life 
And I think by now after 2 months I can make that decision of leaving with higher level of confidence that me leaving is in both sides best interest. I liked it at first, I wanted to give it a chance, but it’s important that one should be true to himself and not compromise about this kind of things although it might be convenient to do so sometimes.
This is what I learned from my toothache. It was easier and more convenient to neglect it for a long time but in the end I experienced so much unnecessary and avoidable pain.</p>

<hr />

<p>The problem with leaving your job is the fear of not being able to land a better one or not having many options. This feeling is inflated with the fact that unfortunately with circumstances out of my hand I already wasted so much time before graduating. I try hard to keep this kind of thoughts from making me settle for a job I don’t like or look forward to.</p>

<p>Thinking about these things while having a toothache is what inspired this post because at that moment I was wondering which one was actually causing me more pain. The toothache is relatively easier to treat and cure obviously, the mental pain is more consistent and profound and harder to cure. I think pain and suffering are essential and unavoidable in life, one should always try to make the most of them and decide which cause or reason he’s willing to suffer for.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="chemical-burn">Chemical Burn</h3>

<p>There’s one scene that always comes to mind when thinking about pain that comes to my mind 
Chemical burn from fight club that scene is one of my favorite scenes of my favorite movie of all time 
When tyler durden poured some chemicals on the narrator hand and  told him that he should face his pain and accept it and not try to escape from it like these scared people do 
And that: 
<i>“It’s only after we’ve lost everything we are free to do anything”</i>.</p>

<p>After a few tries and rejections, self doubts and fears start to magnify and you start to question whether you can afford to achieve your dreams and career goals or you are just destined to work joylessly in something you don’t really like.</p>

<p>For me this is my chemical burn to follow tyler’s advice means I shouldn’t try to shut down this pain I should accept it and acknowledge it and use it to drive myself forward.
I know how easily I can trick myself into believing that things aren’t as bad as they are to delay an uncomfortable decision or  a move.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="seventh-rule-of-fight-club">Seventh rule of fight club</h3>

<p>At this point it might seem like I’m writing this post so that I can talk more about fight club. Most people only remember the first two rules of fight club (which I’m breaking currently obviously) but I find the seventh rule of fight club an interesting one: “Fights will go on as long as they have to” simple as that. I’ll keep fighting for what I want for as long as I’ll have to.</p>

<hr />

<p>This was a very short post. I know I’m trying to gain back some momentum to write more consistently. Let’s hope that the next post will be a celebration of me taking steps in the right direction towards my goals.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I picked this topic today because recently I experienced a lot of pains physically and mentally two weeks ago I had a horrible toothache and had my tooth extracted I’ve ignored for a while and I do regret that Now.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Path of The Rightous Man</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/22/I-lost-it.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Path of The Rightous Man" /><published>2022-04-22T04:45:13+00:00</published><updated>2022-04-22T04:45:13+00:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2022/04/22/I-lost-it</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2022/04/22/I-lost-it.html"><![CDATA[<p>“Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost.”</p>

<p>― Dante Alighieri, The Divine Comedy</p>

<hr />

<p>It’s been a while now since I’ve written my last post and a lot of things happened since then.
The idea of me stopping things like blogging and other activities I like for work or because I’m searching for a job have always haunted me but it seems like it’s to some extent unescapable.
I started feeling like Dante at the start of his journey through hell. The hardest thing after graduation is picking your own path but I found out that even when you know where you are going it’s not always enough.</p>

<hr />

<p>Let’s start by a short briefing of how horrible my new year resolution is going in the first quarter of 2022</p>

<p>I can barely pronounce the Russian alphabet (I wanted to challenge myself by learning a language from a different alphabet) regarding my language learning goals
Only 3 times I attempted to try tidytuesday and weren’t even public ones
I’m gaining weight again and almost neglecting all the computer vision tasks and plans
So in short it’s been hard to keep up with it and basiclly a major failure.</p>

<p>Career wise I was snubbed by Go. I felt bad, like really bad because it was a data related job but I also knew that I wasn’t really the best candidate and I didn’t perform well in the technical screening, so their decision was understandable but it still hurts.
Pushed by the desire to get my first job and get the illusion of financial independence I started another job it’s not as technically challenging or data centric as the one from Go but it still worth exploring two weeks in and I still haven’t fully made up my mind about it yet it has its pros and cons so no easy decision here.</p>

<hr />

<p>I now feel lost, I was so naive thinking I wasn’t naive
Like I’ve always known that life is hard and that life after graduation is a lot harder than before it, but I somehow imagined it to be different. Let’s just say I thought it’s going to be hard in a different kind of way. Wishful thinking is of course one of the worst enemies you can have. It’s essentially thinking about things (or sometimes people) the way you wish they are not the way they really are. It can be a career path or it can even be your own abilities.</p>

<p>I don’t know if my current job will lead me to the career I want but then again do I even know what is? that and most importantly do I have what it takes to make it in that career
I think people, especially younger ones, tend to be passionate about their jobs now even though that’s not a bad thing but personally can view a job that way. I don’t think I just want to be one thing in life even though I know I kind of have to in today’s world.</p>

<p>Do I quit next week even though I had no problems so far or just wait and slowly drift away from the path I thought I’m going to walk? 
I should apply for scholarships and leave? then I’ll think about what will happens but that “then” will definitely come and all of this will be repeated but with the stakes being higher 
I don’t want to give up my dreams but sadly I know I might not afford to follow them sometimes you should just settle and realize that it can be luck sometimes that define your life.</p>

<p>also a realization I had recently that if your life has been hard so far that means it’s probably going to get harder and not the oppiset and a lot of people tend to beileve which is like the Monte Carlo fallacy.</p>

<p>I honestly don’t know what to do at this point of my life I feel there’s only bad and worse decisions here</p>

<hr />

<p>“How you can sit there, calmly eating muffins when we are in
this horrible trouble, I can’t make out. You seem to me to be
perfectly heartless.”</p>

<p>“Well, I can’t eat muffins in an agitated manner. The butter
would probably get on my cuffs. One should always eat muffins
quite calmly. It is the only way to eat them.”</p>

<p>“I say it’s perfectly heartless you are eating muffins at all, under
the circumstances.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest</li>
</ul>

<p>I like this quote a lot because sometimes all we need is little calmness to make the right decision or at least or lack of calmness and mindfulness leads to even worse decisions so for now I’m just going to try to “eat my muffins” without letting the butter get on my cuffs</p>

<p>And by the way (if you haven’t guess already ) The title of this post comes from pulp fiction one of my all time favorite movies this quote said by jules twice in the movie but when he was explaining  what this made up verse meant in the restaurant scene.</p>

<p>“Ezekiel 25:17. “The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.”</p>

<p>“…it could be you’re the righteous man and I’m the shepherd and it’s the world that’s evil and selfish. I’d like that. But that shit ain’t the truth. The truth is you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin, Ringo. I’m tryin’ real hard to be the shepherd.”</p>

<p>I’ve been telling this to myself now that instead of looking at the world as an evil or selfish place it was me who is weak and needs to be stronger.</p>

<p>This is one of my happiest moments of the past few months. I never thought I would miss doing this and the fact that this blog will be 1 year old  in less than 3 months is actually crazy and makes me panic thinking about how fast time is moving.</p>

<p>Hopefully I make another post(s) soon and it won’t take me 3 months to do so.</p>]]></content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[“Midway upon the journey of our life, I found myself within a forest dark, for the straightforward pathway had been lost.”]]></summary></entry></feed>
