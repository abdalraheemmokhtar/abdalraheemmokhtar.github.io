&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of starting a blog for a quite long time now but I just couldn't find the time and the ideas to get started. Now (unlike most of my other ideas) this may actully see the light&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Goal Of This Blog&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I cann't say that my goals for this blog are clear yet, but mainly this blog will be like a place to throw my random thoughts in. Mainly in topics related to data science, machine learning, and other random topics in CS in general&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is like the &quot;Hello world&quot; of blogging I'm very excited writing it right now even though it does not contian any valuable informations.
    Jeff Delaney (the creator of &quot;fireship.io&quot; one of my faviurate youtube channels and a huge inspration for me) once said:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote&quot;&gt;The best time to create a youtube channel was ten years ago, the second best time is now!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can be generlized on internet blogs as well. In a world filled with so many resource online this might seem redundent and useless, but I'm actully doing this for me in the first place i beleive that I will be the one who benfit the most from this even though I'm hoping that this random thoughts i post  can be of any use for a random strangers on the internet&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Final Words&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has only been a test of this whole blogging test I'm still thinking about what would be the first real topic im going to write about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also I just realized how horrable my writing skills are, but let's hope that this can improve along the way lol.&lt;/p&gt;
