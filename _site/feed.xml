&lt;p&gt;I’m largely described as pessimistic person, I can always come up with scenarios where things can go wrong or horribly, and the problem is most of the times they (the scenarios) can be very convincing and logical, I’ve managed to discourage my self and others times and times again claiming to be realistic and wise. That’s why I started this post with that quote not exactly money but anything of value really, most of the times it can seem to be unwise or unrealistic to take risks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was still a kid I thought about changing the world, thought of it as inevitable thing that one day I’ll be someone great but as life went by year after year I started acknowledging that as unattainable goal slowly I’ve become the opposite of that child “nothing I’ll ever do will ever be of any value. why even bother? success in largely defined by luck” this practically been my motto for the past few years. This probably why I never commited to any hobby I like to draw be I’ve always saw my drawings as trash and convinced myself that I do not have the talent&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I want to recover some of that child-like optimism my goal is to work at tesla or comma.ai (both are the leading companies in creating self-drive cars) this is the closest thing I have for a life goal but I don’t want to work there just because its name or salary but to contribute significantly to one of the most fascinating problems mankind has attempted to solve 
(More on this on a separate post)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Is it hard? Yes very&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Is there's a high competition from thousands of highly motivated and dedicated people from all around the world who has better education and overall living conditions? Also yes&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Does it require a lot of hard work and sacrifices without any guarantees of any kind success ? Yes 
Am I going to pursue it despite being aware of all of this ? Yes&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\img\optim.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;unchanged&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s be honest here for a second mathematically and statistically my chances doesn’t look great and you reading this right now might think it’s very far fetched and even laughable and I’ll only end up regretting wasting my time trying to do it, but it’s okay. It’s important to let ourselves be vulnerable to getting disappointed and getting hurt because at the end it’s not about protecting ourselves from getting hurt it’s about not minding it for a greater cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only as career advice it’s the same in friendship and  love without risking being uncomfortable and vulnerable we can’t maintain healthy relationships don’t give in to your psychological defense mechanisms.
I think it’s good to use workout analogy you don’t gain muscle unless you tear your muscles first by doing hard exercises that are beyond your current abilities the recovery of the tore muscles is what makes you gain muscles. Similarly you need to do the same to your mentality the less you’re mentally challenged the weaker you get and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worst case scenario I will learn a lot of things about me and about different things in life and gain a lot of technical skills a long the journey so really it’s not only about the destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s important for me to tell me your opinion on this and whether you believe I can do it or not.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">&quot;Pessimists sounds smart but optimists make money&quot;</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">I’m Back!</title><link href="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/12/04/Im-back.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="I’m Back!" /><published>2021-12-04T07:45:13+02:00</published><updated>2021-12-04T07:45:13+02:00</updated><id>https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/12/04/Im-back</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/12/04/Im-back.html">&lt;p&gt;Let just say that October is now my least favorite month of the year, it started awfully and somehow managed to finish even worse. By 20th October I was at one of the most stressful periods I had in a while academically, socially, financially and most importantly mentally.  The combination of this factors lead me to be in mental state I thought I would never be in  again (state where you do not want to do things rationally and just want to make things go away and misdirecting your anger at the wrong things and people ), but still all of this was somehow bearable because I’m few weeks away from graduating so that was one thing helping me, but When the coup happened few days later the feelings of hopelessness and despair magnified. I was so shocked and I actually laughed for how serreal was the situation. Nothing made sense to me “this can’t be really happening”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly (and thankfully) I’m all good now I think coming back is the prove. I was reminded how little control I have over the course my life , well maybe ‘little’ is not the right word to use, but the point is you should focus only on what is within your ability to change. when will you graduate? Definitely not one of them. I stopped caring to the point I no longer care when or even if I ever do. I’m not a nihilist who thinks nothing means anything even though I admit to think like that sometimes. These kind of feelings stems from not being able to achieve what I believe I’m more than capable of achieving, but then again this projections you have are fundamentally unfair because of your unawareness of your control boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also I want to say that living without internet was one of the best things that happened to me in 2021. thanks to it I finally managed to started reading the books in my library.
one book that I would like to recommed that you read is “deep work” by Cal Newport I didn’t finish it but really like most of what I found in it.
another thing that I was able to do because of the free time I had in the absence of the internet is to listin more to podcast mainly spanish teaching ones and lex fridman podcast which is in my opinion the best of all times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t want to make this long one, so long story short I’m back and I’m better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What brought up this topic was when I came across this quote from Albert Einstein:(Written in old age)”I have never belonged wholeheartedly to a country, a state, nor to a circle of friends, nor even to my own family. When I was still a rather precocious young man, I already realized most vividly the futility of the hopes and aspirations that most men pursue throughout their lives. Well-being and happiness never appeared to me as an absolute aim. I am even inclined to compare such moral aims to the ambitions of a pig.”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This somehow relatable, even though the later part is kind of harsh I mean “inclined to compare such morals to the ambitions of a pig” I wouldn’t go that far, but I’m not here to argue with Mr. Einstein (who would want to ?). I remember while ago on Twitter there was this debate on whereas “money can’t buy happiness” is a complete nonsense and that materialistic pleasure can bring you true happiness or at least comfort and peace of mind. First and quickly I just want to say that I really wish people stopped arguing on Twitter and stopped taking it seriously I rarely ever found someone that changed his mind about something based on strangers opinions on Twitter in one word: it’s pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now back to the Topic. The  way I think of money is that it’s a tool to mainly buy time, for example I won’t work at a job that pays more but takes away so much of my non-work time because that would basically be meaningless. I have to make time for family time for hobbies I can’t be completely defined by the job I do no matter how I’m passionate about it. What’s interesting about our lives is that we can’t always choose the obvious simple solutions. Most of the time you have to calculate a lot of factors, and I think that this where the idea of not having to worry about money can be viewed as proxy for happiness. Now that you have free time and money what do you do? Our brains have this ability to normalize (I also hate Twitter for ruining words, this word for example I couldn’t write it without feeling stupid) any state we are in good or bad. You would crave something for so long and once you get it’s now nothing and the same when you lose something very precious. This essential to make life bearable. I think whereas you have money or not influence largely your views on if it canbring true happiness and fulfillment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Money can give you comfort and time with yourself but the more time you’ll have with yourself the more you’ll look for deeper meaning to your life.
I’m currently broke and I know money can solve many of the problems I have, but in the end I can’t scape me, I know that there’s things that no amount of money can change or fix. It can only distract.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happiness is an indicator that you are living your life in alignment with your own goals and beliefs it can sometimes be in midst of much suffering and physical discomfort (athletes for examples) we are truly happy and on the contrary well-off people might find themselves in valley of despair and life becomes unbearable for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy when I’m writing this posts. I’m also happy to know that some people read them and find them useful or insightful or interesting. For a few minutes every now and then I stop worrying about things I get a piece of paper or open the notes app and pour random thoughts from my mind on it, this simple process makes me really happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three months ago I publish this blog, quarter of an year! time is actually going so fast, 2021 is almost done (the corona virus is almost two years old now huh!) I never thought I write for more than two weeks or something now this is my &lt;b&gt;12th&lt;/b&gt; post here I just wanted to say thank you (again) to anyone who still read them and care enough to provide me with his opinion and thoughts about them, it means alot to me &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">Happiness is for sure one of the hardest topics to talk about, and I know that I said I’ll keep things short and simple, but I actually started this post a few weeks ago.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Recipe For A Disaster</title><link href="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/10/15/disaster.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Recipe For A Disaster" /><published>2021-10-15T10:45:13+02:00</published><updated>2021-10-15T10:45:13+02:00</updated><id>https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/10/15/disaster</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/10/15/disaster.html">&lt;p&gt;At your final year in college your graduation project will probably be the most annoying and time consuming task you had to do throughout your entire academic life. And I’m here today to make it even worse, as I hate giving advices to people I’m going to tell you exactly how to make graduation project your way to a mental health facility. So let’s get started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choosing-your-group&quot;&gt;Choosing Your Group&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This probably the most important step so please do the minimum amount of thinking before doing it and place your choice solely on one factor and that is how close are you with them. I also recommend not paying any attention to any rational selection criteria like how interested or skilled they are in the topic of your graduation project, or things like their work flow and how much they share your ideas and prioritize the graduation project. I also encourage you to choose someone with contradicted sleep and college schedule so that your chances of meeting with them are way less the less you meet the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;choosing-your-topic&quot;&gt;Choosing Your Topic&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe this should have been before choosing your group to don’t worry you are in safe hands. Your college will provide you with full support and advices in exchange you’re expected to create a scientific breakthrough in your bachelor degree graduation project so please choose the most advanced and complicated topics that’s currently puzzling the word most elite scientists. My point is: choose a fancy name for your graduation project. Its name has to be prestigious otherwise how would other people know you’re better than them? 
And oh I forgot, please don’t do any initial search about your topic and things like the data you’ll need, limitations, and other boring stuff. These things will magically solve themselves as the semester progress so don’t worry I told you’re in safe hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;your-supervisor-&quot;&gt;Your supervisor ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who needs one of these? I’ll tell you: loosers. Wait till the research center of your faculty assign a random supervisor to your project or in case you want to choose from the already available projects you can also choose that randomly, but if you insists you can select a supervisor the same way you choose your group members as mentioned above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workflow&quot;&gt;Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As start working on the project always maintain the least amount of communication between you, your group members, supervisor and the research center. Ensure that problems are discovered as close to the deadlines as possible and then waste that remaining time on blaming each other on who’s fault was that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-the-documentation&quot;&gt;For The Documentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use word or any regular text editor don’t ever waste your time trying to learn latex or anything that’s can make documentation easier. You don’t have to document it step by step, do it all at once and for once no iterative work to gradually enhance your work.
Don’t cite your work I don’t even have to say more about this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;for-the-presentation&quot;&gt;For The Presentation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most essential thing in the presentation is to show that you haven’t learned anything useful throughout your work on this project. Pro tip: always agree with the examiners don’t hold your ground and try to defend your work and ideas 
Bounce if you can please show some conflicts or at least ask each other questions about the project during the presentation with your group members this will show the great team spirit that you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations not only you managed to ace your graduation project, you’ve also got the right mindset to start working on your dream career.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short post I know, but I’m kind of busy and not in the mood for writing I’m actully thinking about taking another break until the 17th of November but I’ll probablly publish one or two more before that (as I said before I keep adding to my drafts without being able to finish them) after I finish my degree I’ll try to publish 2-3 post per week unless of course I run out of things to write about but until then I’ll &lt;b&gt;TRY&lt;/b&gt; to keep things shorter and simpler.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">At your final year in college your graduation project will probably be the most annoying and time consuming task you had to do throughout your entire academic life.

I’ve been busy avoiding my responsibilities and as always not doing what I have to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I’m talking about something that seems very personal, but it’s kind of all I’m thinking about lately (and by lately I mean the past few years). It might be surprising to people who “know” me that something like this consumes a big proportion of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Between all feelings, I think that loneliness is the most felt emotion in my life. since I can remember I’ve always felt like an outcast, I had to pretend to fit in and somehow I was good at it (pretending) so good in fact sometimes I even fool myself and the line gets blurry between my true self and the image I have to maintain in order to drive away my feeling of alienation. This actually made things worse because at the cost of having friends I started to lose my identity 
This may sound strange, but many times I can’t truly decide if my judgment of things and people is my own or it’s just shaped by the opinions of those who I desperately wanted thier approval. maybe that’s why I’m a liverpool fan becuase of thier “You’ll Never Walk Alone” motto I’ve always starved for a sense of belonging to something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;who-am-i-&quot;&gt;Who am I ?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I’ve progressed in life and started to know more people I started to develop some narratives about my self one to each group of “friends” family members and relatives. I have to stay in character every day all the time and change between them as needed, it hurts it’s mentally exhausting, but being alone is sometimes more painful than being hurt or at least that how I justified it to myself, but now I don’t think that it has to be. Loneliness is like color blindness but for feelings I can’t be truly happy angry or even sad everything is just a pale version of it self. I always wonder if everyone or at least a lot of people do this that’s why I’ve always questioned the genuintiy of any feelings toward me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;Loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egoistical selves.&lt;/i&gt;”
Sōseki, ‘Kokoro’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A misconception about loneliness is that people sometimes tend to think that loneliness is cuased by family, friends or colleagues but I think loneliness is eternal feeling I think even people in happy relationships and those who have  a loving family can still feel very lonely. Sometimes people don’t even acknowledge it, but there’s like an iceberg of loneliness to each of us  we seek to be understood, like deeply understood, Deep within every human being there still lives the anxiety over the possibility of being alone in the world. But it’s hard to communicate what we truly feel. I strongly believe that no matter how good we know someone and no matter how close we get to them we can’t in our final judgment of that person say we know them 100% even if they wanted to tell us, even if they wanted us to know. There’s always so much to people that you can’t know or comprehend. That’s why I started to take things less personally lately I don’t blame people I don’t hold grudges for someone. But unfortunately more likely than not my understanding for people decisions get confused for a lack of care about them. The way I think about it is that I’m doing people a favor by cutting them off saving them the troubles of dealing with someone who doesn’t even  know who he truly is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt; But even so, every now and then I would feel a violent stab of loneliness. The very water I drink, the very air I breathe, would feel like long, sharp needles. The pages of a book in my hands would take on the threatening metallic gleam of razor blades. I could hear the roots of loneliness creeping through me when the world was hushed at four o’clock in the morning.&lt;/i&gt;” haruki murakami - wind-up bird chronicles&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As someone who’s interested in A.I I wonder if in the future we would be able to create an A.I that’s so good it’s indistinguishable from human. Think of it as a highly sophisticated conversional chat bot where you can choose the theme of the conversation you want to have (or it can determine that automatically) and then generate exactly the perfect conversation for you (does this makes you think about the movie “HER” ?) and think this is achievable but the problem is that humans crave this things from other humans.
Also one thing that this kind of A.I application will never be good at is creating a shared experience that what makes us connect with other people more than anything overcoming problems and enjoying happy moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the feeling loneliness is pretty messed up, still i owe a lot of good things that happened to me to it. If didn’t have the time that was available because my introverted nature I wouldn’t have known half of what I know now. It’s also helps you to understand yourself (and therefore  others) better and reflect on your life decisions  as long as you don’t drift away too much to the dark places your mind can go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“&lt;i&gt;The yardstick for a human being is: how long and to what degree he can bear to be alone, devoid of understanding with others. 
A man who could bear being alone during a whole life-time, and alone in decisions of eternal significance, is farthest removed from the infant and the society-person who represent the animal definition  of a human being.&lt;/i&gt;” soren kierkegaard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember: the time you feel lonely is the time you most need to be by yourself.

Here I’ll go over some basic skills that I think are essential and can have a tremendous impact on your learning and help you in everyday work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;touch-typing&quot;&gt;Touch typing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think everyone who’s doing some kind of work that’s evolves a Keyboard should know how to type fast. There’s a lot of free websites that teach you how to  master touch typing, I’ll give links and descriptions to them below. typing fast is a very satisfying skill to have  and you’ll feel your progress while doing it which is  great if you impatient or the type of person that loses interest in things quickly when you don’t see fast or direct  results, even though I still type at a pathetic rate of (45-50 Word Per Minute according to 10fastfingers ) and it’s even slower when I write code (because of the  parentheses and stuff) still I’ve came a long way from using my index fingers to type almost everything and I’m still improving. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to reach at least 80 wpm by the end of this year&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;speed-reading&quot;&gt;Speed Reading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think compared to typing reading is less obvious skill to improve no one thinks that they actually need to improve their reading speed, but just like typing it’s not only about speed but rather the techniques that allow for faster and more efficient output from reading. I learned this the hard way when I was doing literature review for my graduation project and I had to skim through a lot of papers, books and articles I literally had to read pages diagonally because I can’t read everything, I knew that this had to Improve and I have to read faster without sacrifice my comprehension.
Also similar to touch typing there’s a lot of  websites that help you learn techniques and practice them to improve your reading skills 
When you combine this two skills you’ll find yourself saving a good amount of time that you didn’t even knew you were wasting. average person reads from 200 to 300 words per minute but you can reach much higher rates(x2 or x3 !!)  with practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keyboard-shortcuts-and-basic-command-line&quot;&gt;Keyboard shortcuts and basic command line&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Computer aren’t meant to have mouses in fact computers didn’t even have GUI for a good part of thier existence so you can practically get everything done 
Without even moving your hands away from the keyboard or at least minimize this movement. It wasn’t until recently that I knew the shortcut to delete one word or go back/front one word which made me feel like a cave man for spending my life using mouse and deleting character by character. There’s a lot of very useful keyboard shortcuts that can make your life easier you just need to be patient getting used to them and resist the temptation to use regular ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also have to know the basic cmd of your OS you don’t have 
to be a hacker or something just basic navigation and file directory creation and changing and similar stuff
Also if you have a favorite IDE or (any program actually) it will probably has a quite useful keyboard shortcuts which can make you feel more comfortable and productive using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-uiux&quot;&gt;Basic UI/UX&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just some concepts and familiar with  some design tools
You don’t have to be graphic designer or anything fancy just the bare minimum, but it does make the difference if you are in a any computer science discipline you’ll probably(almost certainly) work on a project that has Users so you need to work with the design teams or at least consider that user experience  with yor software and it will also be useful to have some basic knowledge that’s enables you to understand some decisions about that project. 
Programmers tend to forget that most of the users that use their  programs  will have so little knowledge about the application and how optimized and efficient the code was,  UI/UX is your only why to communicate your “amazing” implementation to the user. I won’t lie of out of all skills in this list this is probablly the least urgent, but still very needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;git&quot;&gt;Git&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it seems like no one “gits” it but it is actually a version control tool that helps you maintain version of your code and can make collaboration with other programmers much easier I won’t go into the technical details here I’ll just leave links below.I’ve created my github account in late 2015 and I have a lot of repos (not a lot actually exactly 35), but until now I don’t fully understand how git really works and I Google some basic commands from time to time to remember what they do, Still, it’s essential skill to anyone who writes code ( or actually any modifiable files not necessary code) to be able to work with git&lt;br /&gt;
Add pull, push, commit are basically all that you’ll need to “git” started once you are comfortable with it you be able to reach new levels in your code quality and make working with others much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;latex&quot;&gt;Latex&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All I have to say here is just that if you hate Microsoft Word then you have to learn latex. again this is something I really found helpful in my last academic year and  it’s now my go to text processor for almost every assignment or project.
Latex can be intimidating at first but you quickly get used to it, and similar to all the previous skills it’s actually worth the effort and time you spent acquiring it.
The best way to get started in my opinion is overleaf which is a good website that gets you started quickly without worrying about setups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;invest-in-your-tools&quot;&gt;Invest in your tools&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a skill of course but it is worth mentioning here. I’d like to encourage you to invest in your tools for the long term, buy a more comfortable chair, a bigger monitor, a mechanical keyboard (now you know what I want for my next birthday) as long as something makes you more comfortable and productive go for it. If you think this stuffs are kind of expensive or unnecessary you might ending costing your self even more money because you didn’t achieve certain level of competence that you could’ve reached with more supportive environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you wondering why this post came out earlier than you expected it’s because I’m planning on taking a break for the rest of September.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">A lot of time we tend to underrate some factors that can actually have huge effect on your learning experience and your whole productivity in general. Here I’ll go over some basic skills that I think are essential and can have a tremendous impact on your learning and help you in everyday work. Touch typing I think everyone who’s doing some kind of work that’s evolves a Keyboard should know how to type fast. There’s a lot of free websites that teach you how to master touch typing, I’ll give links and descriptions to them below. typing fast is a very satisfying skill to have and you’ll feel your progress while doing it which is great if you impatient or the type of person that loses interest in things quickly when you don’t see fast or direct results, even though I still type at a pathetic rate of (45-50 Word Per Minute according to 10fastfingers ) and it’s even slower when I write code (because of the parentheses and stuff) still I’ve came a long way from using my index fingers to type almost everything and I’m still improving. I’m hoping that I’ll be able to reach at least 80 wpm by the end of this year Speed Reading I think compared to typing reading is less obvious skill to improve no one thinks that they actually need to improve their reading speed, but just like typing it’s not only about speed but rather the techniques that allow for faster and more efficient output from reading. I learned this the hard way when I was doing literature review for my graduation project and I had to skim through a lot of papers, books and articles I literally had to read pages diagonally because I can’t read everything, I knew that this had to Improve and I have to read faster without sacrifice my comprehension. Also similar to touch typing there’s a lot of websites that help you learn techniques and practice them to improve your reading skills When you combine this two skills you’ll find yourself saving a good amount of time that you didn’t even knew you were wasting. average person reads from 200 to 300 words per minute but you can reach much higher rates(x2 or x3 !!) with practice.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">What’s The Title of This Post</title><link href="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/09/14/No-Title.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="What’s The Title of This Post" /><published>2021-09-14T14:45:13+02:00</published><updated>2021-09-14T14:45:13+02:00</updated><id>https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/09/14/No-Title</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://abdalraheemmokhtar.github.io/2021/09/14/No-Title.html">&lt;p&gt;Posts are piling up in my draft folder and I can’t seem to able to finish any of them. It’s been almost two months since I started this blog and I’ve been writing about very different topics and I don’t even know which topics I should be focusing on, but I realized that there’s agreement that my previous post (which was a tidyverse tutorial) is the least favorite one so far and that’s kind of predicted, most of people aren’t really interested in the technical parts or at least they’re more interested in my ideas and opinions which is a good thing (I guess).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we like reading relatable things? 
Ironically feeling like no one gets us or no one understands our feelings is actually one of the most relatable feelings of this  generation. Maybe it’s because of the alienating nature of today’s society and social media that made us more self centered. We need other people thoughts to validate our own, we like to be given the right to hate or love certain things or people, humans are very biased creatures, and social media makes use of this all the time by subjecting us to specific algorithmic information diet that maximize your time wasted on them which leads to more revenue for them in return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how relatable my posts are this whole blog idea was something I had in my mind for while, but I wasn’t able to get started until one day I was talking to a friend of mine about things I wanted to do but I didn’t, and blogging was one of them and she told me I should just get started and I’ll have all of her support. I felt very motivated that day and I knew that I should make use of this motivation dose, and that’s basically how this blog came to be.
This made me think: if it wasn’t for that day maybe I would’ve never started this blog. How many other things I could’ve done if I only channeled a temporary surge of motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also remember a similar situation one year ago when I signed up for the Huawei AI associate certificate I didn’t want to take the exam at first for some reasons I thought that wasn’t ready yet and I wasn’t a fifth year student ( the exams were offered as partnership between Huawei and the university for fifth year students or fresh graduates mainly) so I didn’t sign up at first, but then that exam got postponed and some students withdraw and the organizers were looking for people to take their seats and I was like why not ?I won’t let it pass twice, plus I have nothing to lose anyway. I passed the exam and now I’m a certificated Huawei A.I associate and eligible for the Huawei A.I Professional certificate. I’m not fan collecting certificate for the sake of it I believe they can be deceiving, certificate doesn’t prove your skills and knowledge. They are just useful for HR to decide if your CV is relevant or not. I don’t know if this certificate will be useful one day, but it meant a lot for me at that time because for once I saw an opportunity and didn’t shy away from it which is something I rarely do, but I always wished I could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No matter how this blogging thing will go on I will always feel grateful to that friend (and everyone reading this now, I deeply appreciate every single one of you!) And proud of myself because this actually one the very a few things that I wanted to do and ended up doing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we’re talking about motivation A while ago I came across this quote “You won’t always be motivated so learn to be disciplined” I guess every one of us gets highly motivated from time to time maybe at the first of the new year, at your birthday, next week or when starting a new semester or job maybe you can even make some promises and plans, but all of this fades away too soon and you find yourself waiting for the next especial occasion to get started.
consistency is a key we’ll eventually get good only at what we do regularly whether that’s a useful thing, harmful thing or total waste of  time. Yes you can actually get good at wasting time and procrastination I’ve been there before (still there maybe, but I’m getting worse hopefully) and it’s actually quite hard to get rid of this habits, but  sometimes I manage to get around my laziness it’s like surfing, most of the time I’m just waiting still doing nothing, but every now and then some waves (bursts of motivation) shows up and I have to decide quickly which one to ride before they disappear. This helps a little but it’s also very inefficient, motivation will only get you so far, you have to maintain a streak, whatever you’re planning to be good at you’ll have to do it daily (or at least very frequently and consistently) no matter what happens in your life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in the end what is the title of this post? is it about motivation, the importance of supportive friends in your life or is it about my laziness? I don’t know, I can’t come up with a title, maybe you can help me ?&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">Posts are piling up in my draft folder and I can’t seem to able to finish any of them.

&lt;p&gt;As I promised you to talk more about tidyverse and other R packages, this Tutorial is
only a begging so don’t judge harshly I’m new at this. Initially I did not want to make tutorials on this blog because I believed that the internet is full of them, but one more won’t do no harm right ?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;let’s get started, first we need to load the tidyverse library so we can
have access to all the great functions, if you don’t have the tidyverse
library yet you should install it first by running:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# install.packages(tidyverse)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;then now we need to load (attach) the package so we can use it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tidyverse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;like I said before one of the great things in R is that it has many
built in datasets we can choose one to play around with, I’ll use mtcars because it’s one of the most popular datasets with very clear variables&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mtcars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;when you run this line you will get informations about The mtcars dataset
 (like where it came from, what each variable means, etc…). Now we will
turn it into tibble which is according to tidyverse website : “A tibble, or tbl_df, is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. Tibbles are data.frames that are lazy and surly: they do less (i.e. they don’t change variable names or types, and don’t do partial matching) and complain more (e.g. when a variable does not exist). This forces you to confront problems earlier, typically leading to cleaner, more expressive code.”  this is optinal however
this Tutorial is so simple this stuff it wont matter but it’s just a habit for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;as_tibble&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mtcars&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 32 x 11

## # ... with 22 more rows
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see that the data has 32 observations and 11 columns, now let’s make use of tidyverse&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;disp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;## # A tibble: 32 x 4

##    &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;
##  1  21    160   2.62     1
##  2  21    160   2.88     1
##  3  22.8  108   2.32     1

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The select() function works similar to the SQL statement SELECT, as you
can see it’s very easy to choose certin columns but this is not the true
power of tidyverse the “pipe” %&amp;gt;% is very helpful because now we can chain
commands together, we can select some columns and then select individual
cases given a certain condition like for example “show the displacement
and weight and miles per gallon for all the manual (am == 1) cars in the
dataset”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;select&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;disp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;am&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we can add even more conditions and more functions let assume for the
sake of example that there’s something called weight displacement ratio
which is obtained by dividing the displacement of a car by its weight in
1000 of pounds and we want to do this for the manual cars that has high
miles per gallon (let’s assume that this means &amp;gt; 25) we can do all of
this just by running :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Weight_displacemet_ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;disp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;wt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this is very helpful because you don’t want to create new instances of
your dataframe to apply functions to it especially in the first stages
of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay lets do something fun, hmm lets do a very simple
analysis by plotting very simple boxplot to see if there is difference
in mpg in the groups of cars that have a different number of cylinders&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mutate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cyl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;as.factor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;cyl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;box_plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ggplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cyl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;geom_boxplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;box_plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;\posts\TidyTut\box1.png&quot; alt=&quot;boxplot&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy enough, but what an ugly graph lets make things more interesting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-r highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;box_plot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ggplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;aes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cyl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mpg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fill&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Cyl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems that cars with fewer number of cylinders have more miles per gallon which means they are more efficient than cars with higher number of cylinders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let see if there is a relationship between the weight of a car and

Looks like heavier cars tends to consume more gallons than lighter ones.  we’ve gain a good amount of overall informations with few steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See? that was very easy don’t
worry if you don’t understand some of ggplot commands and options I
won’t explain it here today I think it deserve its own tutorial(s). The
whole point of this tutorial was to whet your appetite to go try this for
yourself, in future Tuts we will go through more complicated stuff with
more realistic data, for now I think this is enough for a first tutorial I’m just experimenting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started to learn about machine learning and data science it didn’t make any sense for me to learn any other language than python 
It’s easy to learn and code in,
Requires minimum installations of other programs so you can get started quickly, has a library for almost every thing I needed,  and I already had some experience in it from my web development days (back when I was using Django framework) so learning something like R seemed redundant and  unnecessary so I never really cared about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  didn’t think about R again until my fourth year in college when there was a course on applied statistics which used to be taught in stata and other statistical packages, but lucky for us I think we were the first or second batch to be taught R and I recall that there was some conflicts between the students on which language should be used in the course Python or R, and even though - as I recall- the majority voted for python we were still taught R which turned out to be pretty cool actully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I  won’t lie at first R didn’t seem to offer much more or any thing new because we were studying the basics of the language (variables definitions,  for loops , functions, etc…) and  I was studying it for an exam only (it was the easiest A+ ever by the way), but as always I wish I was told how useful it’s going to be and how important was it to dive deeper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never opened Rstudio for months after that until the next semester when I had some code assignments in R for time series analysis and survival time analysis courses when I looked through the time series textbook  I was amazed by the beautiful plots and even more surprised by how little R code they used to generate this beautiful plots and so I found out about ggplot package which is a R package for plotting based on the “grammar of graphics” (a layered approach to plotting and visualization) which then lead me to discover the tidyverse packages and Shiny web apps and it was so awesome I wanted to re-learn everything I learned before in Python again in R.
One of the best things I found was the #TidyTuesday challenge on Twitter which is a weekly challenge where people form all over the R community try their data visualization and data analysis techniques on one specific dataset for that week .
You can find a very insightful submissions and some people sometimes share their code and steps it’s really very helpful community. Every week I want to participate in #TidyTuesday but I always forget or just get lazy and procrastinate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being exposed to all of this at the same time felt so overwhelming I literally didn’t know were to start, but learning from my previous mistakes I wanted to learn with minimal resources and because R is so amazing there’s a lot of data to play with and experiment on that comes with R and additonal datasets once you install tidyverse package and so I started to mess around, this turned out to be useful when we had to make a project for the design of experiments course, becuase I didn’t like SPSS graphs and ggplot made the project look much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-i-like-about-tidyverse&quot;&gt;What i like about tidyverse&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tidyverse according to thier offical website is “The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures.” and this meant that it’s so intuitive to use the functions names and the overall work flow becomes much easier, but the real game changer is the pipe operator %&amp;gt;% (a fancier and more recent version is |&amp;gt; it’s not fully adoptedyet) this enables you to chain functions together so the output of one function is the input of the other. This meant you can easily implement a pipeline that reads the data , cleans it (remove null values, impute missing value, drop unimportant columns, etc), then does some filtering and grouping and Finally plotting a beautiful graph, and all of this in one line. Tidyverse made me understand why so many programmers now days prefier functional programming paradigm: much cleaner code easier to implement, test and debug. I’m a lazy person I would like to get as many things done with as few steps as possible tidyverse gives me just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing is the whole  community is so helpful (I already said that but it’s worth repeating) you can find very creative solutions to most of your errors and problems and there’s always new updates and new helpful packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;final-note&quot;&gt;Final Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t want this post to be understood as a comparison between R and Python as I said before I hate comparing technologies 
If you love Python and you feel like everything I said is already available for you in Python in a more convenient way that’s completely fine, but I still think it’s useful to approach things from different perspective, personally I was missing out on a lot of cool things in R. It can actually be beneficial to your Python (or any other language) skills, because similar to learning natural languages learning new one can help you understand the other better. I’ve learned a lot of interesting facts about English after studying Spanish for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of this qoute “from a wider perspective, the tidyverse can be seen as sub-dialect of the R language that is evolving to express ideas and tasks inherent in Data Science workflows and software development. This dialect may not be for everyone, but it does seem to be helping many R fluent data scientists frame their conversations.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This  post wasn’t actually meant to be for this week, I was working on something different but it wasn’t ready yet and I didn’t want to lose the momentum. So please excuse me if this seems rushed or short I promise to write more about tidyverse and the most important R packages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you interested in learning more I’ll leave this link to this great post &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/08/teach-tidyverse-2021/&quot;&gt;Teaching the tidyverse in 2021&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Why the drama then? well, I actually thought about quitting before, especially after last post for many reasons, but I reconsidered and decided that I’m not going to. Below I’ll give an explanation to why I thought about stopping this blog, why I changed my mind and when I will really stop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;reasons-to-stop&quot;&gt;Reasons To Stop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I said many times that the main beneficiary from this blog is me, I still however care about the opinions of the people reading my posts (there’s only about 10 currently) and for some reason there was relatively low feed back especially for the last post and I started thinking the wrong way (like I always do) which is that because how uninteresting they are. I thought “no one asked and no one cares about your opinions, they only interacted with first ones out of pity and now got bored from pretending to care”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another reason is that I’m a very scattered person who is always obsessed with learning or trying new things (which can be a very bad trait) and between all of this stuff I really want to learn or try blogging is not a priority right? Well no, and I will tell you why in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-will-not&quot;&gt;Why I will not&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First of all there’s some hidden technical part to this blog for example I have to maintain the code and do some git stuff (basically some commits and pulls and pushs). Also learning something new like markdown which is a more convenient way than html to write posts like this one,  plus This blog is actually made by a Ruby language framework called jekyll ( I never ever wrote a single line in Ruby and probably never will, but am still able to work with it isn’t this amazing ?). These things are not actually complicated, but still in the end they are extra things am learning on the go and they will -hopefully- be useful one day.
Also you might have realized that there’s so many spelling and grammar mistakes and serious lack of fluency (sometimes I forget some words in the middle of a sentence) I never thought about how much I need to improve my writing skills before starting this blog (thanks to you autocorrection), in general, active language skills (speaking and writing) are commonly neglected while learning any language. So to summarize I’m actually learning more about things I didn’t know in addition to the main goal of this blog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly I have almost always been in similar situations like this, where I go from enthusiasm at the beginning then slowly losing interest until I end up in a half done projects which I completely forgot why I even started it. So this time I want to see things through, I want to know what would happen in the end (if there’s an end to this ) I think had my fair share of (what-if)s so far. Finishing things really improve our mental state since it leaves little to overthink about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-least-comfortable-choice&quot;&gt;The least comfortable choice.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to come up with excuses to give up. The way I thought about this is actually me just being both lazy and coward if you think your content is not good enough you improve it, You don’t just giving up the whole thing. 
I really hope that I’ll be able to do as many uncomfortable things in my life as possible. Almost all of the good things (and people ) require certain level of risk and discomfort at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-will-i-ever-stop&quot;&gt;When will I ever stop?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that I made things clear on why I would keep blogging it’s time to tell you when will I stop. Actually there’s is basically one thing I’m  afraid of becoming which is being fraud. I don’t like pretentious things or people.
There’s a song called “smoke and mirror” by gotye I always feel nervous when listen to it, Because I’m afraid of getting used to people praising my mediocre skills and no I’m not hating on myself here or trying to be humble, but I think that’s they don’t know enough about the things I do to make a good judgment. For example if someone who doesn’t even know what a  web server is kept telling you that you’re a good back-end developer it wouldn’t mean anything to you right ? .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog started to look like a dairy so I’m thinking about making more technical posts next. This makes it 4 out of 4 in august I’m feeling proud actually, might treat myself to an Ice cream or something haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week midterm will decide if there’s a post or not. Wish me luck !&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Abdalraheem</name></author><summary type="html">If think this is actually my last blog post then I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not going to stop, at least not for the foreseeable future.
